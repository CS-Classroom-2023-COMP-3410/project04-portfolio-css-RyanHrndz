Responsiveness
My website adapts well to all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop, using CSS media queries. Spider-Man’s agility and adaptability inspired me to ensure the site could work seamlessly across devices, much like he swings through various environments. Just like Spider-Man adjusts to challenges, I ensured no content is cut off or requires unnecessary scrolling.
Design and Creativity
Each page is themed after a different Spider-Man character, reflecting their unique personalities and styles. Spider-Man has been my favorite superhero because of his creativity and relatability, so I used bold colors, hover effects, and dynamic layouts to reflect his adventurous spirit. The designs aim to immerse visitors in a world that honors the Spider-Verse.
Code Quality
My code is clean, well-structured, and thoroughly commented to make it easy to follow. Inspired by Spider-Man’s sense of responsibility and precision, I ensured every line of code was intentional and optimized. This approach mirrors his meticulous planning and execution during his battles.
Functionality
All navigation links work correctly, and the responsive layout ensures a smooth experience across devices. Spider-Man’s web-slinging precision inspired me to create seamless functionality, where every click feels purposeful and leads users to their desired destination. Accessibility was also a priority, ensuring that everyone could enjoy the site.
Reflection
Creating this project allowed me to channel my love for Spider-Man into a creative outlet, honoring my favorite superhero’s resilience and creativity. Challenges, like image paths and responsive design, reminded me of the obstacles Spider-Man overcomes with determination. This experience deepened my appreciation for web design, much like Spider-Man’s journey inspires me to tackle challenges head-on.
